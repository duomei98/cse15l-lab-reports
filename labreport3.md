I researched 4 interesting command-line options for the `less` command. Normally, `less` displays the contents of a file without printing the entire document (as `cat` would do) and thus is a way to quickly look through a file.

## …ᘛ⁐̤ᕐᐷ 🍒 《OPTION 1: `-p`》 🍒 

`-p <pattern>`: tells `less` to start at the first occurrence of the pattern in the file 

**🍒 EXAMPLE 1**
```
$ less -p "Result" rr166.txt
```

This input looks for the first occurrence of the word "Result" in the file `rr167.txt`. This is useful because if I was doing research on the link between pulmonary disease and smoking (or whatever this file is about) and I needed a reminder as to what the result of the experiment was, I could quickly go to it without having the scroll through the entire file.
_Output:_

**🍒 EXAMPLE 2: **
```
$ less -p "pulmonary disease" rr*.txt
```

This input looks for the first occurrence of the words "pulmonary disease" in all .txt files that begin with "rr". This is helpful if I needed to find information related to pulmonary disease, but I don't remember which file it was in. 
_Output:_

> `Pattern Not Found (press RETURN)` means that the phrase "pulmonary disease" is not in this file.

> Scrolling to the bottom of the file and typing `:n` allows you to go to the next page. I learned this from the website ([Link](https://flaviocopes.com/linux-command-less/#:~:text=In%20this%20case%20the%20behaviour,to%20go%20to%20the%20previous)

> I continued going to the next file until I found one that contained "pulmonary disease."
