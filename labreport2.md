**üçí String Server Code:**
![Image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/717565547268669500/1099959946801582131/Screen_Shot_2023-04-24_at_12.28.03_AM.png?width=1828&height=1236)
My StringServer code takes in the command line arguments as a String array. If no port number is given (for example, if we type only `java StringServer` in the command line), the main method reminds you to type in a port number because our web server requires a port to run on. Otherwise, it takes the port number and creates a server with that port and using our Handler, which I will discuss in further detail below. 
* The method that is called in my code is the main method in line 17.
* The relevant argument to this method is an `int` port number. For example, one command line input is 
```
javac StringServer.java
java StringServer 4567
```
It creates a url `http://localhost:4567` that represents my StringServer.
* I wrote my code in a way that didn't use fields.

> _Note: the urls I entered were `http://localhost:4567/add-message?s=two birds` and `http://localhost:4567/add-message?s=on a wire`. According to my research, because spaces in urls are not allowed they were replaced with `%20`_

I decided to use a helper class Handler, modeling my code off the NumberServer code we worked with in lab. I modified the `handleRequest()` method to still accept an url as a paramter but now initialize a variable `str` that is an empty string. Then, I take the query of the url, which is defined as anything after the `?` (such as `"s=two birds"` in **1**), and concatenate the string after `=` in the url (such as `"two birds"`) to my variable `str`. Finally, I use the `format()` method to display the updated string in my web server. 
* The method in my code that was called was the `handleRequest()` method in line 6.
* The relevant argument to this method is the url of the webserver shown in the two screenshots labeled **1** and **2**. 
* I did not use fields in my code.

## ‚Ä¶·òõ‚ÅêÃ§·ïê·ê∑ üçí „ÄäPART 2„Äã üçí 

I will be addressing the bug in the `reverseInPlace()` method in the file ArrayExamples.java.

* A failure inducing input includes any input array that has unique values for each index, such as the test I wrote below.
```
  @Test
  public void testReverseInPlaceEvenArray() {
    int[] input2 = {1, 2};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input2);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{2, 1}, input2);
  }
```
Here is the output of running this test. The failed test is the test I wrote above:

> Symptom

* An input that doesn't induce a failure is any input that has the same value for corresponding indexes `i` and `input.length - i - 1`, aka indexes the same distance from the front and back of the array.
```
  @Test
  public void testReverseInPlaceDoesNotFail() {
    int[] input1 = {1, 1};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{1,1}, input1);
  }
```
Here is the output of running this test. Evidently, all tests passed:

> Symptom
* Before (original):
```
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
  ```
  * After (fixed):
```
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < (arr.length / 2); i += 1) {
      int placeholder = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
      arr[arr.length - i - 1] = placeholder;
    }
  }
```
Explanation of bug:
The original method was bugged because when you update the value of `arr[i]` to reverse the array, you lost the original value, meaning that you can‚Äôt actually reverse the second half of the array. For our `input2 {1,2}`, when `i = 0` our code updates `arr[0]` to `arr[1]`, changing the array to `{2,2}`. Then, for `i = 1`, our code updates `arr[1]` to `arr[0]`, but no index value actually changes because the original value, 1, was lost. Our revision fixes this bug by storing the original array value in a placeholder variable, and also changing the iteration length to only half the array, so that when you iterate through the first half of the array, you are actually reversing the indexes at `arr[i]` and `arr[arr.length - i - 1]`, aka the indexes equidistant from the front / back of the array.

## ‚Ä¶·òõ‚ÅêÃ§·ïê·ê∑ üçí „ÄäSTEP 3„Äã üçí Trying Some Commands

1. To see the difference between running commands on the remote server versus your personal computer, create a new terminal using *ctrl + shift + `*. 
2. This will give you something like this, where the `ssh` is the remote server and `zsh` is your personal computer.
![Image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/783745953680326656/1094744747375067136/Screen_Shot_2023-04-09_at_3.04.38_PM.png?width=2520&height=554)
3. Try running some commands on both servers. Examples include: 
* `cd`: the command `cd <path>` switches the current working directory to the given `<path>`
* `ls`: the command `ls <path>` stands for list and is used to list the files and folders in the given path 
* `pwd`: stands for "print working directory" and is used to display the current working directory 
* `mkdir`: allows you to create new directories (_Note: make sure you have permission from the computer you're working on, or else you may get a `permission denied` message!_)
* `cp`: the command `cp <path1> <path2>` stands for copy and is used to copy the file at `<path1>` and move it to `<path2>`. If `<path2>` does not exist, it first creates that file before proceeding as aforementioned

Example Output:

4. On your `ssh` server, try running these specific commands: 
* `cd`
* `cd ~`
* `ls -lat`
* `ls -a`
* `ls <directory>` where <directory> is /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/cs15lsp23abc (abc is one of the other group members‚Äô username)
* `cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt ~/`
* `cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt`
