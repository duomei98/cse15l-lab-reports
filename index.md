* I am a great artist! Not to brag or anything, but I *did* get a 5 on my AP Art exam ( ✧≖ ͜ʖ≖)
* I draw pretty boys! Which, of course, is always a plus (*ps if you know the references I took these images from I love you*)

> The harbor wind had lifted her dark hair, and for a moment Kaz was a boy again, sure that there was magic in the world.

  This last example is few and far in-between, because in my heart of hearts I will always love drawing people above all else. Backgrounds are absolutely horrible. I'm not an art major for a reason...

2. Cute girls
