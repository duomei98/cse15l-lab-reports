## …ᘛ⁐̤ᕐᐷ ♥️ `《Reasons to follow me》` ♡( •ॢ◡-ॢ)✧˖° ♡ 
* I am a great artist! Not to brag or anything, but I *did* get a 5 on my AP Art exam ( ✧≖ ͜ʖ≖)
* I draw pretty boys! Which, of course, is always a plus (*ps if you know the references I took these images from I love you*)

  This last example is few and far in-between, because in my heart of hearts I will always love drawing people above all else. Backgrounds are absolutely horrible. I'm not an art major for a reason...

Well I don't know how to add videos so you'll have to wait.
