* I am a great artist! Not to brag or anything, but I *did* get a 5 on my AP Art exam ( ✧≖ ͜ʖ≖)
* I draw hot dudes! Which, of course, is always a plus (*ps if you know the references I took these images from I love you*)

  This last example is few and far in-between, because in my heart of hearts I will always love drawing people above all else. Backgrounds are absolutely horrible. I'm not an art major for a reason...

## ♥️`《My favorite things to draw, if you haven't guessed》`♥️
1. Real people! 
* *This is a bit of a recent development, but I've been obsessed with stylizing people from reference photographs so that they're in my style yet still recognizable!*
2. Cute girls 
* *No explanation needed* ε=ε=ε=ε=┏( ￣▽￣)┛
3. Ships. See the illustration section... 
* *Again, no explanation needed...* (*ﾟｰﾟ)ゞ

Ahem.
